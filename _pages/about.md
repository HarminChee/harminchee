I am an M.S. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at [UC San Diego ECE](https://ece.ucsd.edu/). I received a B.S. in [Mathematics and Information Engineering](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/programmes/bsc-in-mieg/) from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/chinese/index.html). During my undergraduate years, I worked as a research assistant in CUHK’s [Advanced Wireless Systems Group](https://wireless.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) under the guidance of [Prof. Soung Chang Liew](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/liew-soung-chang/) and [Dr. Yuyang Du](https://yuyangdu01.github.io/), conducting research in generative AI and AI for networking. I also collaborated with [Prof. Rosanna Yuen-Yan Chan](https://www.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/faculty/chan-yuen-yan-rosanna/) for my undergraduate capstone defense research. Prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Min-Te (Peter) Sun](https://wasn.csie.ncu.edu.tw/advisor) at National Central University, Taiwan. In industry, I served as a Machine Learning Application Intern at Deloitte Hong Kong.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on large language and vision-language models (LLMs/VLMs) and machine learning for systems.

- Accelerated inference and generation for LLMs and multimodal models: efficient decoding (e.g., speculative and batched decoding), KV-cache management, quantization and distillation, routing/MoE scheduling, and systems-level optimizations that improve end-to-end latency–throughput–quality trade-offs under practical constraints.
- Multimodal reasoning and efficient perception with vision-language models: robust grounding and alignment, retrieval-augmented perception, parameter-efficient adaptation for resource-limited settings, and evaluation protocols that stress long-context understanding and cross-modal consistency.
- ML for systems with verification in the loop: topology-aware representation learning for network configuration generation and validation, and retrieval-augmented repair for HDL/DFT that couple similarity search, compiler/test feedback, and automated checks to deliver reliable fixes.

I am also interested in applications of LLMs in education, engineering, and scientific discovery.
